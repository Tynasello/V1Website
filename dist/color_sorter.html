                    The purpose of this project was to create a system that would sort objects based on color. I
                    chose skittles as the objects to be sorted. Two micro servo motors were used in the project; one to
                    pick up the skittles and one to drop them into designated cups. A TCS230 color
                    sensor was used to read the color. Red, green, and yellow skittles were sorted
                    and dropped into corresponding cups.

                <h3>Arduino Uno Micro Controller</h3>
                <p>

                    The arduino uno is a microcontroller that is responsible for commanding the two servos and the
                    color sensor. Code is sent from my laptop to the arduino.
                    The arduino has digital input/output pins and analog pins that are responsible for sending and
                    receiving data. The arduino is powered via a USB port.

                <h3>Micro Servo Motors</h3>
                <p>
                    Two micro servo motors were used in this project. One was attached to the circular
                    rotating platform and was designed to pick a skittle up from the entry tube. It was then
                    transferred
                    underneath the
                    sensor where the color could be calculated. The skittle was then dropped onto the slide. The second
                    servo was
                    responsible for properly angling the slide to the correct cup, based upon the color of the
                    skittle previously detected.

                <h3>TCS230 Color Sensor</h3>
                <p>
                    The color sensor contains 64 photodiodes in total, 16 red, 16 green, 16 blue, and 16 clear. The
                    photodiodes on the color sensor are responsible for sensing the color of the skittles. The
                    sensor's readings are converted from current to frequency allowing the arduino to determine the
                    skittle's color. A website that assisted me in my understanding of how the TCS230 color sensor works
                    can be found <a

                <h3>Framework</h3>
                <p>The frame was built out of scrap wood that I cut, hand sanded and drilled together. The rotating
                    platform was hand made and fitted to one of the servos. It was designed to pickup skittles from
                    the entry pipe and bring them directly underneath the color sensor. They were then transported to a
                    drilled
                    hole in
                    the shelf where they would fall onto the slide. The slide was designed using the back of a drywall
                    corner bead.
                    It was strategically shaped to function like a slide. The pipe was
                    cut from a roll of rubber hosing and was used to house the skittles to be sorted.

            <h3>Coding <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i></h3>
            <p>The program to control this robot was written in the <a
                    class ="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/
            main/software">Arduino IDE </a>using the programming language C/C++. The Servo.h library was included to
                control the two micro servos. Two micro servo objects were created, one for the job of
                picking up the skittles, and the other for setting the path towards a certain cup. The micro
                servos
                were controlled using the
                write() function
                that would turn the servos based on the degree amount inputted. The TCS230 color sensor was utilized by
                using the pulseIn() function that would read the output frequency detected by the sensor. These
                values were then inserted into three different if statements (one for red, green, and yellow) that would
                determine skittle color based
                on pre-determined frequency numbers that corresponded to each color. A link to my github repository for
                this code is below.

            <h3>Overcoming Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout this project I faced two significant issues that I had to overcome. The first was the
                inability of the arduino
                to
                accurately differentiate color as a result of
                color frequencies being too similar. To remedy, I continually
                adjusted the distance
                between the platform and the sensor
                allowing more variety in frequency numbers to occur. The arduino could now distinguish between
                different colors.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second problem was getting the entry tube for the skittles to work properly. I
                originally had a transparent piece of tubing, however, the diameter of the tube was approximately a
                1/8"
                larger than that of a skittle. This extra room allowed skittles to topple to the sides of each other
                which resulted in them getting stuck. After experimenting with various sized tubes, I eventually
                found a size which functioned reliably.
